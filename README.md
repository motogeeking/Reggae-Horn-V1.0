# Reggae-Horn-V1.0
Reggae Horn project for motorcycle

This is a fun project to create a horn for your motorcycle, but can be used for just about anything
that you can think of. Please have fun with it and please use it responsibly.

This program was written using Great Cow Basic v.0.97. GCB is totally
free and can be downloaded from http://gcbasic.sourceforge.net. You
will need a pickit 3 to program your PIC microcontroller.

Really any small micro can be used for this as long as it has serial communications capability at
9600 bps 8N1. Don't hate if you don't like PICs!
